## Limitations of the current tool:

- It relies heavily on explicitly defined foreign key relationships. In some databases, especially legacy systems or those with performance optimizations, foreign key relationships might not be explicitly defined in the database schema.

- It doesn't capture more complex relationships like many-to-many relationships that use junction tables.

- The tool might struggle with very large databases, as the visualization could become cluttered and hard to interpret.

- It doesn't capture business logic relationships that aren't reflected in the schema (e.g., implicit relationships managed in application code).


## Shared tables and unconventional schemas:

- Some organizations use shared tables for multi-tenancy, which might not be captured well by this tool.

- Schemas that use generic key-value pair tables for flexibility might not be represented accurately.

## Potential improvements

- Include analysis of indexes and constraints.

- Add support for stored procedures and views.

= Implement a way to visualize data volume or query frequency for each table/relationship.

- Allow for manual addition of relationships or annotations.

- Implement zooming and filtering in the visualization for large schemas.

- Add support for different database types, including NoSQL databases.
